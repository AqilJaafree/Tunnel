# Tunnel 

## Prediction Market Platform

Tunnel is a decentralized, no-loss staking platform built on the Flow blockchain that makes cryptocurrency staking engaging and educational through gamified knowledge challenges based on real-world news events. Users stake FLOW tokens to earn passive yields from network delegation, with challenges acting as a fun, skill-based layer to unlock or accelerate those yieldsâ€”without any risk of losing principal or accrued rewards.

### Core Concept

The platform creates a habit-forming experience similar to quiz apps, where participation rewards accuracy and research, promoting long-term retention and financial literacy. Tunnel pools user stakes and delegates them to Flow node operators, generating sustainable yields (typically 4-8% APR after node cuts). Predictions are resolved trustlessly, focusing on skill over chance, ensuring capital preservation while adding interactive elements to traditional staking.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”’ No-Loss Staking & Vesting
- Users deposit FLOW tokens into a secure, pooled system delegated to Flow node operators
- Yields accrue continuously and are distributed pro-rata based on each user's share
- Principal and yields are protectedâ€”never deducted, even on challenge losses
- Stakes lock indefinitely or with a cooldown (e.g., 30 days for withdrawals)

### ðŸ“Š Daily Credit System
- Stakes generate non-monetary "credit points" for participating in challenges
- Credits refresh daily via block timestamps (24-hour cooldown)
- Formula: `currentCredit = (principalShare + lockedYield) * dailyRate`
- Promotes daily engagement without financial pressure

### ðŸŽ¯ Gamified Knowledge Challenges
- Educational quizzes on news events with research-backed questions
- Binary predictions (yes/no) with verifiable resolution data
- **Correct Answer (Win)**: Unlocks accrued yields instantly + bonus multiplier
- **Incorrect Answer (Loss)**: No penaltiesâ€”yields continue accruing but stay locked
- Features leaderboards, badges, accuracy streaks, and level progression

### ðŸ’° Yield Generation & Unlocking
- **Passive Base Yields**: From Flow staking rewards, distributed pro-rata
- **Locked by Default**: Yields build up but require correct challenge or vesting period to unlock
- **Post-Unlock Options**: Claim to wallet or compound to principalâ€”all fee-free
- **Bonus Yields**: Funded sustainably from protocol reserves

## Flow Official Staking Protocol Integration

Tunnel leverages Flow's native staking infrastructure for secure, audited yield generation without custom contract complexity.

#### Key Elements Explained
* **User Deposits FLOW**: Start by funding your wallet and preparing to stake
* **Register Delegator**: One-time setup using FlowStakingCollection to create your staking resource
* **Delegate to Node**: Choose a node ID and lock FLOW (min ~50 FLOW)
* **Epoch Cycle**: Network runs for ~7 days; your stake helps secure it
* **Rewards Calculation**: At epoch end, rewards are accrued (4-8% APR, 8% node fee)
* **Claim Rewards**: Withdraw to your wallet or compound (restake)
* **Unstake**: Request to unlock; wait for epoch delays before full withdrawal
